Numbers
Integer: used to store whole numbers, e.g. 50.
Float: used to store numbers with decimals, e.g. 50.12.
Boolean: used to store True or False values.
Complex: the definition for complex numbers is outside the scope of this lesson.
  
Strings and characters:
A character is a single letter, digit or punctuation symbol.
A string is basically a sequence of characters.

Note that the values are printed with spaces between them.
It is, however, possible to override the separator between the listed items from the default single space by
using the statement sep= as an extra variable in the print() statement.

Every print() statement ends in a newline character \n at a default.
It is possible to override this by adding an end= statement as an extra variable to the print() statement.
This may be used to remove the line break or newline functionality.
