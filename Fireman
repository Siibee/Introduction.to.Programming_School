#Create a module file called fireman.py. In this file create a class called fireman.
#A fireman has a name, surname, staff number and age. There should also be a count field which keeps track of the total number of fireman in the system.
#All fireman instance variables / attributes should be initialized in the class constructor.
#The total number of fireman should also be incremented in the class constructor.
