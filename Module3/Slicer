#Create a script name slicer.py. In this script, prompt the user to enter a string of text, an index inside the string where a substring should
#start and an index inside the string where the substring should end. Make use of what you know of error handling to ensure
#that if a start index is outside of the bounds of the string it is set to the first element / character in the string and if an end index is
#set outside of the bounds of the string it is set to the last element / character in the string. Display the substring to the user.
