# Define a set

# Populate the set with the names of your 5 favourite fast foods (no user input required).
# Define a second set and populate it with the names of a friendâ€™s 5 favourite fast foods (no user input required).
# Add another type of fast food to your set of favourite foods.
# Determine which favourite fast foods are shared by you and your friend and display these overlapped foods.
