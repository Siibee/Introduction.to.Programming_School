#Generators:
#Yield statement
#
#Create a script called yield.py.
#Create and define a function and name it yield.
#Create a range for your function with specifying your initial value and an increment. 
#Underneath your function, create a variable and set your variable to the initial value which you have specified in your range. 
#Underneath your increment variable, create a while statement and make it loop infinitely (HINT: the True keyword ðŸ˜Š)
#Using the yield keyword, yield your initial value variable and set an increment
#
#Now create separate variable calling your created function and add arguments to your range (so define your variables) 
#
#Print your first variable calling your function. 
#Once this is done, create a for loop for your first function. 
#Set an iteration and write an iteration where the iteration is less than your maximum number in your range. 
#Create a break
#Create a false statement to print your iteration 
#
Do the above for your second function
