Create a script called SalesCalculator. The script should request 10 sales values from the user using a loop.
# If the value entered by the user is less than 5000 the rest of the current loop iteration should
# not be performed. If the value is higher than 5000 and less than 10001 the current sales total and sales
# average of the user should be printed to screen. If the value is higher than 10000, the loop should stop
# entirely and a message should be displayed that a possible data entry error has occurred.
#print()
#haven't done this yet.
